# 🐭 Micro-Mouse Power Module  
### Power System for a Maze-Solving Robot

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project involves the design, development, and testing of a power module for a simplified micro-mouse robot. The micro-mouse is a small autonomous robot designed to navigate and solve a maze. While the processor, motherboard, and sensing modules are pre-designed, this project focuses exclusively on the power subsystem—an essential component responsible for delivering stable and reliable energy to all parts of the robot.
